        Project Specification:
    This project is created as application computer graphics's first assignment.
    Task of the assignment is making intersection test and depth test for created spheres.

        Project environment and version:
    This project developed on PyCharm IDE and Python programming language.
    Python programming language version is 3.6

        Project Structure:
        Tree Representation:

        |-camera-|
        |        |-Camera.py
        |        |-OrthographicCamera.py
        |
        |-object-|
        |        |-Group.py
        |        |-Object3D.py
        |        |-Sphere.py
        |
        |-scene-|-scene1.jpg
        |       |-scene1.json
        |       |-scene1_depth.jpg
        |       |-scene2.jpg
        |       |-scene2.json
        |       |-scene2_depth.jpg
        |
        |-FileReader.py
        |-GraphicsDriver.py
        |-Hit.py
        |-Ray.yp

        You can visit and look file contents by using above Tree Representation.
    At this time, the system has one type of Camera named OrthographicCamera, one type of Object3D named Sphere.

        HOW TO RUN PROJECT:
    On the system, Driver is the main class and allocated in GraphicsDriver.py file.
    When GraphicsDriver.py run, than the main class will run automatically.
    If you need to change the screen resolution, you can change frame_size(x, y) values from Driver class's getScene function.

        Difficulties and Time Management:
    Actually, this project is not hard. But presentation and resources from the internet are not clear because there is no clean explanation.
    So, I was worried about achieving the task. Shortly, the main difficulty is understanding lecture notes, because explanation and formulas are not clear.
    For example, there are to many formula but there is no good explanation about variable and usage formulas (when I asked that is the his variable,  I did not find exactly answer).
    But, when I start to project, I understand that intersection problem is high school problem and than I learn usage the formulas.
    Time management: Coding did not take much time but I spent time search resources for understanding the topic. The project took about 10 hours.

        Comment:
    This assignment is very useful for understanding the current topic. So, I get enjoy during coding, because I had learning.
    I understand that if we do not start doing and action, we can not learn anything, so thank you teacher.
